# Codeforces Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).  
It serves as a personal collection for practice, learning, and improving problem-solving skills in algorithms and data structures.

## Structure

- **Contest folders**: Organized by contest number or name.  
  Example: `Contest123/`
- **Problem files**: Each problem is saved in its own file with a clear name.  
  Example: `A_ProblemName.cpp`, `B_ProblemName.py`
- **Language**: Solutions are primarily in C++ and Python (specify if you use other languages).

## How to Use

1. Browse the contest folder to find a problem.
2. Open the corresponding solution file.
3. Study the approach, algorithms, and implementation.
4. Optionally, try solving the problem on Codeforces yourself before checking the solution.

## Notes

- All solutions are my personal implementations.
- I aim to use clean and readable code.
- Comments are added for clarity where necessary.

## Future Plans

- Add more problems from ongoing contests.
- Include explanations and algorithmic insights.
- Expand support for multiple programming languages.
